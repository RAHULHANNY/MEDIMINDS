## 🎮 Game Concept
- **Story Start:** The hero’s flashback video sets the stage — stranded on a mystical island after a storm.
- **Goal:** Escape the island by mastering Python.
- **Gameplay:** Each zone or “huddle” represents a core Python topic (Variables, Loops, Functions, etc.).
- **Rewards:** Earn XP, badges, and tools as you solve challenges and unlock new zones.
- **Final Level:** Use everything learned to open the temple and claim the Treasure of Knowledge.
